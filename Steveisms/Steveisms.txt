@section 	Notes
	A bucket in the back of the nave, for the congregation to take when they need it. "So what if they did"

	Congregation readings during sermon

	Asking questions during sermon, the conversation this sparks

	Having each member of a sermon write their name to a post-it, re-distribute these and have each person prove over their note at some point that week (e.g. David 'Oak' Degoyette for me)
