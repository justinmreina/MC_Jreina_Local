	Eph 2:11
	1 John 4
	When god is at work, sometimes it takes faith to step out and follow
	"Lord I need this", "Lord I need help in this". How often do you ask?
	The lord pursues relationships with us, sometimes this takes effort
	The amazing news of the gospel is not that we can receive him, it is that he has already has received us, and it ready and waiting!
	Running away from love, Steve's new definition for disobedience
	I can always give love, it comes with him in my life
	Not giving love is the same as running from it
	Love the sinner, hate the sin
	Love is opposite of hate, not fear
		*Changing to this changes the message you share
	Perfect love drives out all fear
	Sometimes when all love is lost, your answer is grace, give forth!
	God is on the offensive, he pursues
	Be sure to consider periodically, are you running from his love?
	Be careful on items of leisure, pleasure & self-praise, they are but distractions, from your walk and from him!
	Quit running from love, and embrace his grace
	I don't know god, but I have met him
	When you divide & give love it multiplies
