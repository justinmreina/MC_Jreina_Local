	How grace gets unpacked
	Knowledge puffs up, love builds up
	1 Peter 60-64 AD (Rome)
	Gentile, Jesus & Hellenized Jews 		<- research these
	Early Jewish church spoke in tongues 	<- research these
	Why was Peter writing to the Gentiles?	<- research these
	Nero persecuted christians heavily
	Peter was the apostle most written on. He was a leader, asked Jesus questions often
	Have you ever wanted your life to mean more than your profession? 	<- Write on it
	It took time, and we saw it, Peter's growth into this man of faith
	Bill's hope and prayer, that we reach and read 1 Peter, then read it over
	"May grace and peace be multiplied to you" - Peter
	In the beginning Bill thought family & marriage was all you needed. Now he sees that begin with our father, up in heaven is the goal.
	It doesn't take much, we seee that we need him too, his cleansing and his peace
	"Where there is no grace, there is no peace" - Bill
	He is there, this the core piece of his message!
	Research - Nero & Jesus
	Satan's only job is to kill, steal & destroy
	You don't struggle with X, Y & Z. You struggle with being like him, in his image and with his presence
	"When Jesus is walking with you, peace is multiplied. He is a good shepard" - Bill
	"He is the target, and he is the vessel to get there"
	"God, you're enough"
	God's not mad at you. He wants a relationship with you
