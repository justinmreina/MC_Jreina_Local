@section 	Steve Talking Topics
	The meaning of 'discernment', a topic Danielle sees of importance in for you right now
	The difference between communication and talking, and how often this is missed and the costs
	The 7 Truths book ends with "I don't think I ever knew the power of Christ until I came to the point of depression". Heh? Discuss!
	Steve said in 10/1 sermon "Only god is good."  Ask for context, and to understand better!
	Discuss the difference between spiritual love and tangible love, the difference between love from our father and love for things. Discuss the risks or costs to mixture and consider the importance of seperation
	Discuss your realization of target vs. focus, and discuss how this effects a person personally vs. spiritually
	They had become so comfortable in the richness of the Lord, it becomes the presumption and our assumption, for our control and guidance - Ezekiel 21:21
		*discuss how often this occurs in our own lifes, how easy it is to assume the graciousness and power of his gift in our lives. Control feels so good, but is not permanent and misses the point!
